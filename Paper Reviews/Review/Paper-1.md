### 🫠 Paper Name :
- Toward News Authenticity - Synthesizing Natural Language Processing and Human Expert Opinion to Evaluate News

### 🚨 Personal Review : 
- Good Paper 

### 👏 Author Background : 
- ECE Department Faculty of NSU

### 🤷 Domain : 
+ NLP
+ Blockhain - Etherum
+ Incremental Machine Learning
+ Fake News Evaluation

### 🙏 Abstract Summary : 
- Biased news headlines driven by profit or socio-political agendas flood mass media, causing confusion and manipulation among the public
- A blockchain, smart contract, and incremental machine learning-based news evaluation procedure for the Bengali language News was introduced to evaluate news and NLP the model was incrementally trained to detect deprived fake news

### 🏆 Achievement or Claimed : 
- Create an NLP model based on Bangla Bert models using Transfer Learning.
- Propose decentralized news verification (by human experts) using blockchain technology governed by a smart contract.
- Present a novel synthesis procedure combining human opinion and machine decision.
- Improve the performance of the NLP model by incrementally training the model with new data
- During experiments, the NLP model with initial training and testing accuracy of 84.94% and 84.99% was increased to 93.75% and 93.80% after nine rounds of incremental model training.

### 🎯 Technique Used 👍:

### 📚 Dataset:
- The dataset was collected from BanFakeNews which collected data from different sources and created a brand-new dataset on Bangla news. They chose the dataset from twenty-two of Bangladesh’s most widely read and reputable news portals

### 😡 Limitation (Future Work) : 
- Blockchain technology has not yet been implemented in practical applications because it is still in its early phases
- Data-driven machine learning is always susceptible to intentionally corrupted data, which will pose difficulty for the model to perform, and hence might completely fool the model.

### 🫣 Compare with Other Work :

### 🔙 Background : 
- Wallace Chipidza pointed out the impact of toxicity on the establishment of COVID-19 news networks in political subcommunities on Reddit in his paper 
- Shannon McKeown examines the connection between Donald Trump’s Twitter insults and conventional propaganda techniques in his study to evaluate the impact and reach of his social media presence.
- A hoax detection model for the Indonesian language was demonstrated by several Indonesian students utilizing a dataset of 250 pages of real and fake news stories 

### 🤔 Summary : 
A platform where you give a message and it returns whether it is authentic or not based on the model's training (NLP) or you can vote on whether you agree with it or not (Human Opinion) : which also helps the model to adjust its parameters and provide more accurate results. Blockchain is used to maintain user privacy. Combination of NLP and Human Opinion to evaluate the fake news..
