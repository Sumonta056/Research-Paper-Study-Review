### 🔙 Background :

- Proposed the work where they utilizes the naive Bayes and fuzzy classifier to classify tweets into positive, negative or neutral behavior of a particular person
- In [12], they consider the problem of classifying documents not by topic but by overall sentiment determining whether a reviewis positive or negative.
- In [8], they have done their sentiment analysis in detecting insults and flames. This inspired us to choose and work on our class criticism in Bangladesh Cricket in our dataset
- Bengali language on Twitterdata to find the polarity of a Bengali text if it is positive or negative
